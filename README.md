# Simulation and calcul of Random Systems


This python librarie implements an algorithm to simulate and study a
density dependent population process, to compute its mean-field
approximation and its refined mean-field approximation.

## List of fonctions available 

**To be done**

* [2-choice model](Example_2choice.ipynb) 

## Dependencies

This library depends on the following python library:

* numpy
* random
* scipy
* sympy 
* matplotlib.pyplot
