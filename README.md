# Simulation and calcul of Random Systems


This python librarie implements an algorithm to simulate and study a
density dependent population process, to compute its mean-field
approximation and its refined mean-field approximation.


## Documentation

### List of fonctions available 

Most of the functions are documented and their documentation is
accessible by the "help" command.

Apart from that, the documentation is mostly contained in the examples
below (from basic to more advanced). 

### Examples

* [Simple SIR model](BasicExample_SIR.ipynb)
* [2-choice model](Example_2choice.ipynb) 

## Dependencies

This library depends on the following python library:

* numpy
* random
* scipy
* sympy 
* matplotlib.pyplot
